"In a perfect world..." 

Remember when you were a kid, landing face first at a construction site as the plywood of your impromptu ramp buckled under the weight of you and your bike?  How all of your friends would laugh at what's left of you and your Huffy, then you'd go home crying to Mom, and she'd just roll her eyes and put rubbing alcohol on your wounds?  You'd howl in agony, and she would say, 'In a perfect world, you'd have adjusted the ramp's theta and your initial velocity to account for the *combined* mass of you and your bike over the midpoint - which you should have reinforced for good measure?"

And you'd look at her and think, "Yeah, well in a perfect world, boogers would be health food?"  

I don't know.  I was a dumb kid.  Anyway...

We all know there's no perfect world.  Even in data, where we're told another phrase, 'the numbers don't lie.' 

Yeah, they do.  All the time.

Forget the fact that correlation not being causation is overlooked 90% of the time because no one researches questions without preconceived solutions anymore.  And it's not data's fault.  No, data lies because, in its raw form, it's just garbage.  If information was a city, raw data would be its dump: no one would talk about it, and every day it would grow bigger and nastier while citizens pretend it's not there.  

It continues getting trucked in 25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

Just look at your own life!  You use your debit card at a gas station, then at a grocery store, then at a parking garage, then at a restaurant... you get the point: you use it everywhere to buy multiple things, and the data stored from your card's information increases in magnitudes human beings have never known.  

But for Data Scientists - Data Engineers, specifically - all that data needs to be cleaned up, or else it's just useless.  While part of me hearkens back to the days of cash transactions and privacy, I also understand that our economy is insanely cutthroat, and businesses need to figure out how to reach their customers better before their competitor does.  

Enter dbt.

Short for 'data build tool,' it was conceived and continues to be developed by Fishtown Analytics, a software company out of Philadelphia, PA.  In a HUGE nutshell, dbt lets you clean data before putting it into your data warehouse.  Your data warehouse is where all your data users make their queries and ask questions about their business and their customers.  You don't want all that garbage going into your warehouse because, let's face it, "Main Street" to one credit card company is "Main St" to another.  And, God forbid, you ever get your hair done at "[Mane Street Haircutters] (http://manestreethaircutters.com/index.html)" in Williamsville, NY.  (That's a real place; linked for proof.)
